### Aim, Instructions
Finish all five laser tag arenas as quickly and with the fewest shots as possible.
You play the role of a sergant, namely Sergant Brown.
He has to shoot at most five criminals per arena (in each arena, there will be one more criminal).

You control the green policeman, the criminals have the colour red.  All are equipped with a laser tagging device.  You shoot where the green dot is.
The red dot shows where the criminals are aiming.  Beware about this.
Once you've been hit, you have to start all over again.
Eliminating all criminals advances you to the next arena.

Each arena is completely dark.  You won't see any walls, unless you use the infrared camera.  This makes everything, including criminals, visible for a short amount of time, until everyting goes black again, and you only see your and the enemies' aiming point.

You can use the infrared camera every five seconds, as shown by the indicator at the top "Infrared Camera: Yes/No".
Also, the current arena is displayed at the top.
